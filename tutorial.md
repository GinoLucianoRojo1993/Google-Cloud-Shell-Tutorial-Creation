# Tutorial on Google Cloud Vision API

## Google Cloud Vision API
As per the documentation available [here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), Google Cloud Vision API enables developers to understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in an easy to use REST API. It quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g., "sailboat", "lion", "Eiffel Tower"), detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images. You can build metadata on your image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable new marketing scenarios through image sentiment analysis.

In this tutorial, we will get started with the label features in Google Cloud Vision API, where we will provide it with an image and ask it to tell us about the labels that it found in the image.
